# Assembly
This is the Israel Open University System Programming Lab course project - the final project in the course.

The authors of this project are me (Vladislav Panin) and Itay Krishtal.



The goal of the project is to create an assembler for an artificial machine language.
In the documentation folder you'll find the specification of the machine language/codes, as well as the required instruction set.

We have created a two-pass assembler to reach our goal.
